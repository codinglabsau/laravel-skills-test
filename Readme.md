## CodingLabs Skills Exercise

#### 1. How long did I spend to complete this test?
I spent about three hours on completing this test. But I spent extra two hours on configuring composer on my laptop. Because I used the cloud development environment of Griffith to develop my project.
#### 2. What was easy?
The whole test is relatively easy compared to the assignment I did for this trimester. I am familiar with migration, seeder, model, controller, and view. But I came across some new problems I did not know before. I did research to figure out the solutions, which was interesting.
#### 3. What was hard?
As the test required to back to the home.blade.php with a success message to the user, I did not expect it was hard to achieve. But the variable $message I used was not delivered to the home.blade.php from the Post controller. I spent half hour to figure out the problem. I set a flash message in my store function and then to check if the flash message exists or not on the home.blade.php. Finally, the problem was solved.
