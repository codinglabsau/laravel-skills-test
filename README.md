1. 
I spent around 15 hours completing this task all up, over the course of a few days. 

2. 
Understanding the concepts of what was meant to be happening and the task itself was realtively simple and straightforward. 

3. 
Understanding what was actually happening in order to troubleshoot problems, learning how to implement the different components of the webpage/database, finding resources online that relate to up-to-date syntax, and learning php/Laravel + html from scratch through this test was difficult. Finding correct, specific syntax online for how to properly use different functions was also quite difficult, as the official documentation didn't always contain the information needed. Prior understanding of php/Laravel and html would probably have made this easier, however I didn't want to miss this opporunity.
