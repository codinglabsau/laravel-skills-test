# How long did you spend to complete this test? 

The total time for all main tasks and two of the bonus points was 3:10:00.
The first part I spend around 2:00:00
The second part, including the PR took me 1:10:00

## What was easy?
The test was not difficult, but I confess that I probably felt like it was hard for me to keep it to the scope. I found it good to recall the basics of Laravel, but I often found myself researching to implement more that the task was asking.
The most easiest tasks for me was related to the setup, migration, seeding and factoring.

### What was hard?
It was not hard, I took more than expected due to constant checking and researching ways to better implement what it was required. Even with a bit of experience in Laravel this test showed me that I still need some work with the basics.
