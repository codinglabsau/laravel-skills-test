Laravel skills test for Paul Firth

How long did you spend to complete this test? 

I spent about 4 hours on Friday night relearning how laravel functions as it had been about 2 years since I worked in it last.
I spent about an hour and a half coding it on saturday morning.

What was easy?
Building the post controller and validation, prearing the migration and seeding.

What was hard?
Took me a while to configure my enviroment as its been a while since I setup laravel. 
I couldn't get the image resizing to work so I left that out and I also haven't previously written testing in laravel, so 
I wasn't able to setup a test for the post.

Thankyou for the oppertunity.
