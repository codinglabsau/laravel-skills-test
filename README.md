1. How long did you spend to complete this test? 
    I spend around 3 hours to complete the task. I added an extra feature like displaying 
    the post for each specific users with Pagination and Sorting.
    
2. What was easy?
    The task is straight forward and is very easy. There's a bit of back and forth
    in the laravel documentation specially in the Blade Template as I am used
    to working with API and with Javascript as the Frontend.
    
3. What was hard?
    I haven't completed the optional challenge on uploading the image. I think this
    will be a bit of challenge since, it's been a while since I have worked
    on uploading images. Again going back and forth with the documentation for
    this.
