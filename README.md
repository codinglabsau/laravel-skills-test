1.How long did you spend to complete this test?
The actual laravel project? Like an hour, but I spent 3 hours trying to set up the Homestead VM and Server before just doing it on the local server that is integrated into Laravel and creating and editing files in Brackets 

2. What was easy?
The actual test really, it all was pretty basic, although this may only be because I have used Laravel before.

3. What was hard?
As mentioned above, trying to set up the Homestead development environment as I haven't really worked with a VM before
