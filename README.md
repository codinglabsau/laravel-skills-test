# How long did you spend to complete this test? 

The total for the first tasks was 1:20:10

## What was easy?
The test was not difficult, but I confess that I probably felt like it was hard for me to keep it to the scope. I found it good, to recall the basics of Laravel, but I often found myself trying to implement more that the task was asking.
The most easiest tasks for me was related to the setup, migration, seeding and factoring.

### What was hard?
As mentioned above, I found it hard to not go overboard and implement other actions such as edit, delete and create other pages for the posts.
