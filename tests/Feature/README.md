1. How long did you spend to complete this test?
I completed the bonus tasks, plus added some extra features so I spent a bit longer. About 1.5 hrs with the following out-of-scope additions:
    - Full CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Edit
    - Adding email verification with Mailtrap
    - Social Login (Google)
    - Validation: unique post name excluding self

    Some extra sugar:
    - Autofocus on fields
    - Post-user relationships
    
2. What was easy?
There's nothing unusually difficult

3. What was hard?
I hadn't used Vite before, so I had a crash when running NPM. The solution was just to read the docs and update Node.JS to the latest version on my computer.
